            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>The factory guages the mod provides do not allow for a clear overview of the usage of each specific item in the production pipeline. When trying to decide how many of each item you need stockpiled for the factory to work without any bottlenecks, this would be a useful statistic. This being the case as the demand on a resource might exceed the amount stored if not configured correctly.</p>
            <p>The na√Øve solution is to simply store each item in a seperate vaults and combining orders with re-packagers, but as this <a href="https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/issues/7663">bug report on the official mod github page</a> suggests, this does not currently work as intended. As such, this tool served to enable us to have an item buffer in the factory that can combine the resources, given that we know the expected load of resources by the manufacturing process.</p>
            <p>Similarily to the difficulty overviewing resource need, there is no method provided for analyzing the traffic load at different adresses. This may make it difficult to spot which ones are being used the most and need the increased throughput.</p>
